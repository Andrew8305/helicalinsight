## What is it

Helical Insight is the World's first Open Source Business Intelligence framework which can help you derive insights out of your one or multiple datasources. Helical Insight is having all the features which you generally expect out of any BI tool (be it open source or proprietary). Being a framework, Helical Insight is highly extensible via APIs and SDK, thus features can be extended whenever required without compromising on your business requirement. 

Helical Insight also comes with a unique Workflow rule engine, allowing you to call any functionality of Helical Insight or external functionality and thus empowering you to implement any sort of custom business process.

Use HTML skillset and Java skillset to add functionalities at the frontend and backend respectively.
